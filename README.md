# Multi-Digit-Recognition-using-SVHN-Dataset
A deep learning project for recognizing multi-digit numbers using the SVHN dataset. The model is trained on preprocessed data from house number images (32x32 RGB) and predicts digit sequences accurately. Data is loaded from a .pickle file, and the project demonstrates real-world applications of computer vision and OCR.
